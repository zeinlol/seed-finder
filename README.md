2. For communication with Minecraft sources use [Amidst tool](https://github.com/toolbox4minecraft/amidst). They need to be placed at `assets` folder ([download here](https://github.com/toolbox4minecraft/amidst/releases)). Some of them are added in this repo. Use this step just for updating (the latest version will be using).
